# json-statham

I am Json Statham. That's right. I am the JSON representation, of the one and only, Json Statham.

You may know me from a couple of stories. So it's suffice when I say: I can deliver your package. I'm fast and I'm furious.

# 1. Pass me some info

```sh
npm run json-statham project example_project config '{"path": "~/Desktop", "git": true, "node": true}' directories '["test"]' files '["README.md", "index.js", "test/index.js"]'
```

# 2. Let me deliver you a package
